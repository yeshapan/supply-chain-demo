## **Supply Chain Graph Analytics - Use case Demo**
This project serves as an official use-case demonstration of how PuppyGraph rapidly transforms complex relational data into an analyzable graph structure, 
(therefore enabling advanced dependency tracking and risk assessment in a supply chain context)

The primary objective is to solve the critical business challenge of tracing multi-level dependencies

### **Architecture and Data Integration**
The data remains consolidated in its original source while PuppyGraph overlays the graph structure for querying.

**Data Flow:**
* Relational Source: PostgreSQL stores raw tables
* Graph Mapping: schema.json config file automatically instructs the PuppyGraph Engine on how to:
    * map Postgres tables into graph nodes
    * link tables into relationships (edges)
* Real-Time Analysis: The PuppyGraph Engine uses the JDBC connection to execute Gremlin or Cypher traversals
  directly against the relational data (provides real-time analytics without data duplication)

### **Examples of Analytical Use-cases (Gremlin and Cypher Queries)**

#### **1. Supplier Failure Impact (Ripple Effect)**

Ques: If *Supplier A* shuts down, which car models are afffected?
```groovy
g.V().has('Supplier', 'name', 'Supplier A')
  .in('is_supplied_by')   //find Parts supplied by A
  .in('is_composed_of')   //find Features those Parts compose
  .in('with_feature')     //find Car Models those Features belong to
  .values('name').dedup()
```

```cypher
MATCH (s:Supplier {name: 'Supplier A'})
MATCH (s)<-[:is_supplied_by]-(p)  //find Parts supplied by A
MATCH (p)<-[:is_composed_of]-(f)  //find Features those Parts compose
MATCH (f)<-[:with_feature]-(cm)   //find Car Models those Features belong to
RETURN DISTINCT cm.name
```

* SQL would have required four-table `JOIN` for this
  * And this complexity grows exponentially with each added layer of dependency
* Graph can just walk the dependency chain

#### **2. End-to-end Trace (Full Lineage)**

Ques: Visually map the entire production path from raw material supplier to final car model
```groovy
g.V().has('Supplier', 'name', 'Supplier A')
  .in('is_supplied_by')
  .in('is_composed_of')
  .in('with_feature')
  .path()
```

```cypher
MATCH path = (s:Supplier {name: 'Supplier A'})
  <-[:is_supplied_by]-(p)
  <-[:is_composed_of]-(f)
  <-[:with_feature]-(cm)
RETURN path
```

* SQL would require a complex 4-table `JOIN`
* Graph simply needs a 3-hop traversal to return full path

#### **3. Identify "bottleneck" parts (Centrality)**

Ques: Which parts aremost crucial? (Used by the most Features?)
```groovy
g.V().hasLabel('Part')
  .project('PartName', 'ImpactedFeatures')
    .by('name')
    .by(__.in('is_composed_of').count())   //count incoming edges (Features)
  .order().by(select('ImpactedFeatures'), desc).limit(5)
```

```cypher
MATCH (p:Part)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:is_composed_of]-(f)
RETURN p.name AS PartName, 
       count(f) AS ImpactedFeatures   //count incoming edges (Features)
ORDER BY ImpactedFeatures DESC
LIMIT 5
```

* SQL would require heavy aggregation (`GROUP BY` and `COUNT`) across multuple joined tables
    * This forces DB to materialize large temporary tables
    * Slow process + locks up resources
* We can calculate **degree centrality** directly on graph

#### **4. True Cost Roll-up per feature**

Ques: Calculate the total manufacturing cost of a specific feature (by summing prices of all it's raw parts)
```groovy
g.V().hasLabel('Feature')
  .project('Feature', 'TotalCost')
    .by('name')
    .by(__.out('is_composed_of').values('price').sum())
  .order().by(select('TotalCost'), desc)
```

```cypher
MATCH (f:Feature)
OPTIONAL MATCH (f)-[:is_composed_of]->(p)
RETURN f.name AS Feature, 
       sum(p.price) AS TotalCost
ORDER BY TotalCost DESC
```

* If SQL query for summing across heirarchical joins is not written perfectly it can lead to "Cartesian product" problem
  * Can lead to duplicate counts (so incorrect financial metrics)
* We can simply traverse graph structure and use built-in sum() on price attribute


#### **5. Single Point of Failure (SPOF) Audit**

Ques: Find names of Featuers relying on parts from *only one* supplier
```groovy
g.V().hasLabel('Part')
  .where(__.out('is_supplied_by').count().is(1))   //filter for Parts with only 1 supplier
  .in('is_composed_of')   //find Features that use these risky Parts
  .values('name').dedup()
```

```cypher
MATCH (p:Part)
// Filter for Parts with exactly 1 supplier
MATCH (p)-[:is_supplied_by]->(s)
WITH p, count(s) AS supplier_count
WHERE supplier_count = 1

// Find Features that use these risky Parts
MATCH (p)<-[:is_composed_of]-(f:Feature)
RETURN DISTINCT f.name
```

* SQL needs complex conditional filtering:
    * group parts by supplier
    * filter for parts where supplier count is one `HAVING COUNT(supplier) = 1`
    * join restricted result back to Features table
* We just use a simple traversal filter (`WHERE`) to find nodes lacking alternate paths

## **Steps for Local setup and Replication**
> Pre-req: **Docker Desktop** has to installed and running on your system

1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeshapan/supply-chain-demo.git
cd supply-chain-demo
```
2. Launch the stack
```
docker-compose up
```
3. Access the dashboard
   * Wait for engine to boot + schema to load
   * Open browser to: `http://localhost:8081`
   * Login credentials to PuppyGraph UI:
       * username: puppygraph
       * password: puppygraph123
   
4. Run queries!! 🥳
